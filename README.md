# Fundamentals-of-Programming-Csharp
This is a simple C# Console App I've made by going through the exercises in the book
and putting a bit of a twist on the things I've learnt to make a fun/interactive C# Console App

The exercises originate from the free pdf book "Fundamentals of Computer Programming with CSharp" by Svetlin Nakov
